# Old School RuneScape client

I wanted a plain game client, so I cloned [bmoyer/osrsclient](https://github.com/bmoyer/osrsclient) and removed all of the extra features.

[Updater](src/main/java/com/matevzfa/osrsclient/rsloader/Updater.java) module is an adapted version of the [Updater](https://github.com/zeruth/OSJR/blob/master/src/os/jr/ui/Updater.java) from [Zeruth's OSJR project](https://github.com/zeruth/OSJR).
